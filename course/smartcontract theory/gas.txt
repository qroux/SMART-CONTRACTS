Gas and gas limit Section 1 Session 26

2:21: excel with pricing for each operation

Gas depends on complexity of the operation(s)
if you don't grant enough gas, the operation won"t be performed


gasPrice = price the sender is willing to pay PER UNIT OF GAS
ex: simple addition will cost 2gas, if gas price is 5wei, total price will be (2gas * 5wei) = 10wei

startGas/gasLimit = maximum amount of gas we are willing to consume (you don't necessessarly know howmuch gas it will take to perform the operation)
= stop the operation if it takes more gas than the gaslimit i set.
