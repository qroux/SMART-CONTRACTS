solidity common mistakes

1) real Eth network TAKES TIME (30sec at least)

2) public + storage variable = get variable function automatically generated

3) arrays and dynamic arrays
    - solidity allows nested dynamic arrays

    const myArray = [
      [1,2,3],
      [1,2,3],
      [1,2,3]
    ]
    - in javascript web3 allows nested dynamic arrays
    - the bridge between solidity and JS DON'T allows nested dynamic arrays.

    NB: strings are in fact stored in solidity as dynamic arrays! so they are not directl acessible from JS.


4) no real random function in solidity. sudo random
