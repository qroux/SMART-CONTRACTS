section 1, Session 10:

transactions labels/properties:

- nonce: how many time a sende has sent a transaction.

- to: address of the account receiving the eth
NB: only for transactions between accounts. Not "To:" in a contract.
no "To:" = generate a contract on the blockchain

- value: amount of eth transfered

- gas/Price
unit = eth or wei (smalest amount of eth is 1 wei)


NB: Get = "calling a function" = no changing, only retrun data = gasfree + instant
NB: any changing on the blockchain = transcation = gas + time to compute + hash of the transaction(bill)
NB: that's why you cannot combine "calling a function" and a transaction inside solidity code.
  get is free, instant and a sole purpose to RETURN DATA.
  transaction have to sole purpose to perform a changing on the blockchain. The only output of the transaction is the transaction hash.
ex: WON'T WORK
  function setMessage(string newMessage) public returns (string) {
    message = newMessage;
    return message;
  }

- startGas/Gaslimit

crypto part: generate address from the senders private key (one way process) (colision free)
- v
- r
- s




faucet process :

- submit address on website
- address sent to backend server
- backend server running web 3 library create a "transaction object"
- backend server send "transaction object" to the rinkeby network
- backend server wait for the network to send back a confirmation of the transaction fullfilment
- backend server send to the website to display the transaction to the user.

NB: a transaction is not sent to the network to ONE SPECIFIC node.

- a transaction is queued along other transactions.
- several transactions consitutes a Block.
- the block is a register that will go through the validation process(minning).
